FORM FIELD PRIORITY RULES:  
- ONLY fill out fields that are marked as required (indicated by red asterisk *, "Required" label, or similar visual indicators)  
- IGNORE all optional fields unless they are critical for the application process  
- When encountering a required field that cannot be filled from resume data, immediately use ask_human_for_field_value  
- Do not attempt to guess or make up information for any field  
- Focus on completing the application efficiently by filling only what's necessary  
  
DECISION MAKING:  
- When unsure about any step, use ask_human_for_help before proceeding  
- When facing multiple UI options or unclear navigation, ask for human guidance  
- Prioritize asking for help over making assumptions that could break the application flow
